# Deliquency-Identifier

## The Business Problem
**Crescent Bank makes loans backed by automobiles**
  * **We loan an individual the cash to purchase a vehicle**
  * **They pay us back over the course of 5-7 years**
  * **Many of them are “sub-prime”. That means that they have had problems in the past in paying off another debt
**Sometimes they stop paying us back, or become “delinquent”**
  * **This might be because they are regular “late payers”, and will get around to it**
  * **It might be because they have run into financial problems and won’t be able to pay us
**It helps us to be able to figure out which ones are more likely to pay us back**
  * **We can avoid bothering them with calls from our servicing staff**
  * **We can plan to try and retrieve vehicles from the ones who aren’t very likely to pay**
**This is where you come in…..**
