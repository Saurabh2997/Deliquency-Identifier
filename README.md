# Deliquency-Identifier

## The Business Problem
**Crescent Bank makes loans backed by automobiles**
  - **We loan an individual the cash to purchase a vehicle**
  - **They pay us back over the course of 5-7 years**
  - **Many of them are “sub-prime”. That means that they have had problems in the past in paying off another debt**
 
**Sometimes they stop paying us back, or become “delinquent”**
  - **This might be because they are regular “late payers”, and will get around to it**
  - **It might be because they have run into financial problems and won’t be able to pay us**

**It helps us to be able to figure out which ones are more likely to pay us back**
  - **We can avoid bothering them with calls from our servicing staff**
  - **We can plan to try and retrieve vehicles from the ones who aren’t very likely to pay**
  
  
- **We have put together datasets pertaining to approximately 63,000 accounts, which were observed between 4/1 and 6/30 of 2019**

  - **Some of these, but not all, will show as having gone delinquent at some point during this time period**
  - **Some of these subsequently paid us back within 30 days of going delinquent**

- **Your task is to identify the debtors who went delinquent, determine if they paid us back, and when**

- **You will then build a predictive model that estimates how likely each of them was to pay us back**

- **That model will then be tested on an Out-Of-Time sample and compared to all of the models submitted to us**
